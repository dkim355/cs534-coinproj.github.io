					<p>For this project, we are implementing from new approach by adding features: size recognition, edge detection, radius detection, size comparison, and stacked coin comparison. There are various recognition systems that can detect shapes and images, but we wanted to build a program to recognize and categorize coins with overlapping images and surface images of coins. </p>

							<h2>Procedure</h2>
						</header>
						<p>&emsp;Our implementation focuses on creatiing the most robust and accurate functionality of a coin detection/counting program. It starts of by allowing the user to select an image through an interactive GUI. At this point the user must also indicate wheteher or not there are overlapping coins in the image. This helps improve the speed at which our program runs as we can omit checking for overlapping coins if the user indicates this as acceptable. Next, once the user has inputted all the necessary information, the program loads the image and resizes it (by shrinking and adding padding) to fit into our interactive display window. After this it adjusts and makes the lighting uniform in the image so as to achieve the most accurate possible results with our detection algorithm. Once this is done it converts the image to binary and begins moves to the next phase of our implementation.</p>
						<p>&emsp;Here the program uses our hue detection algorithm and creative masking to isolate the pennies in the image. We will later use the pennies as the basis of our radius comparison in order to identify each coin. Once the pennies have been isolated we run a hough transformation to find the center and radius of all pennies in the image. Once, done we find the average radius of all pennies detected and move on to the next phase.</p>
						<p>&emsp;In this section, we first use the same Hough Transformation process to find all the centers and radii of every coin in our image. From here we implement our complex counting algorithm in which we compare the average penny radius to all the radii we found and classify each coin accordingly. The coins are then outlined and labeled and the image is overlaid with the calculated total.</p>
						<p>&emsp;From here we took a few significant measures to insure the program stayed robust and accurate. The first is our failsafe for when no pennies can be found in the image. The program displays an error and allows the user to manually overlay a line graphic across the diameter of any type of coin they choose. The program then takes this information and computes the theoretical radius of a penny in this image. With this information it then computes all the values as previously described.</p>
						<p>&emsp;The second measure is an overlapping coin algorithm. In certain cases where the coins in the image overlap with each other at a ratio of ~50%. Our implementation can not properly identify the coins. To account for this we created an error checking algorithm which determines the amount of overlap each coin has with the others and throws an error if any two coins overlap more than allowed.</p>
						<p>&emsp;With all of these robust checks in place our algorithm can safely compute a highly accurate total for many different scenarios. Collectively, our implementation contains many different features which ensure this accuracy as well as a favorable user experience. </p>
